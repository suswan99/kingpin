Your task is to redesign and code the website for [King Pin Donuts](http://www.kingpindonuts.com/). It should have at least two distinct "views" -- we require Home and Menu pages. For the Menu page, you don't have to include all the menu items; just include a reasonable amount (we recommend 8-10 items). Everything else is up to you!

This means that you have the creative freedom to add or remove content, change up the layouts to your liking, and customize the visual design. Read this whole page for complete details on grading, deadlines, and deliverables.

Reminder: While coding up your website, it is essential to link multiple pages properly so the audience can easily navigate the website by following links on your webpages. If you're unsure how to, ask us!
